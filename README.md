2. Overflow can be deteted either by running tests or by writing an implementation meant to check for it, such as by writting an if statement
that checks to see when the sum owerflows and becomes negative. The overflow is produced when n = 256. 
3. Using type long the value for n that produces an overflow is now 65536. Again, overflow can be detected by setting up an if statement 
meant to check to see when the sum overflows and becomes negative.
4. The overflow occurs at n = 35. This can be deteted by setting up an if statement that tests when the product reaches inf.
5. The overflow occurs at n = 171. This can be deteted by setting up an if statement that tests when the product reaches inf.
6. The function diverges, therefore the value of said function is impossible to predict. It can be computed however, and the double function 
both calculates the value faster and is more accurate.
7. A float is only a single bit precision, so the lack of accuracy produces a rounding error. 
8. Doubles are 64 bit precision data types, so they have a much greater degree of accuracy, allowing the program to avoid a rounding error.
